## Abstract

Mean World Syndrome is a perceived cognitive bias in which people tend to see the world as cruel, a feeling that is amplified by repeated negativity in media. However, whether or not the media tends to trend more negatively in their reporting is unknown. This project aims to consider different variables that may affect the sentiment of news headlines in order to understand whether there is a tendency for negativity and how it varies across different news categories and publishers.
